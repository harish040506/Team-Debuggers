Career Compass – Agentic AI Career Readiness Platform
Team Name: Team Debuggers
Team Lead: Harish Manukonda
Track: Agentic AI
Status: Idea + Partial Implementation

1. Overview

Career Compass is an AI-driven career readiness and diagnosis platform designed to help final-year students and early-career professionals understand why they get rejected during job applications and what exactly they need to improve.

Instead of providing generic career advice or isolated test scores, Career Compass introduces a comparison-based evaluation approach. The system benchmarks a user’s profile against profiles of candidates who actually get selected and surfaces hidden gaps that traditional tools fail to reveal.

The platform follows an Agentic AI paradigm, where the system continuously:

  a. Understands the user’s profile
  b. Reasons over skills, roles, and market expectations
  c. Plans personalized improvement paths
  d. Provides actionable feedback and next steps


2. Problem Statement

Hiring today operates as a black box.

Many candidates:

  a. Meet the stated job requirements
  b. Perform reasonably well in tests
  c. Still get rejected repeatedly

Existing career platforms typically focus on:

  a. Resume scoring
  b. Aptitude tests
  c. Generic skill recommendations

However, these systems do not explain rejection in a comparative context. They fail to answer the most important question candidates have:

“Why was someone else selected instead of me?”

The lack of transparency leads to confusion, misdirected preparation, and repeated failure without clear feedback.
