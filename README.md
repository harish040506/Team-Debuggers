Career Compass – Agentic AI Career Readiness Platform
Team Name: Team Debuggers
Team Lead: Harish Manukonda
Track: Agentic AI
Status: Idea + Partial Implementation

1. Overview

Career Compass is an AI-driven career readiness and diagnosis platform designed to help final-year students and early-career professionals understand why they get rejected during job applications and what exactly they need to improve.

Instead of providing generic career advice or isolated test scores, Career Compass introduces a comparison-based evaluation approach. The system benchmarks a user’s profile against profiles of candidates who actually get selected and surfaces hidden gaps that traditional tools fail to reveal.

The platform follows an Agentic AI paradigm, where the system continuously:

Understands the user’s profile

Reasons over skills, roles, and market expectations

Plans personalized improvement paths

Provides actionable feedback and next steps
